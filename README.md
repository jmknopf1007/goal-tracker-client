# Elevate! App

Elevate! is a web application that helps users streamline as well as organize their<br>
daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals for a given objective (ex. "Learn Python").<br> 
The idea for this app was to create a tool to help make the process of learning  
a new skill easier, and more efficient.

The program is built to guide you through:<br>

## Project Status

For the next version of this app I would like to add a Completed Objectives page.<br>
This page will document all of the completed objectives/ goals for a specific user,<br>
and also have charts, graphs, and other visual elements to provide further analysis<br>
on a user's progress with each of their objectives.
