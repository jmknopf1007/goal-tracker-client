## Elevate!

Elevate! is a web application that helps users streamline as well as<br>
organize their daily goals for a given objective (ex. "Learn Python").<br>
The idea for this app was to create a tool to help making the process of<br>
learning a new skill easier, and more efficient.

# Project Status

For the next version of this app I would like to add a Completed Objectives page.<br>
This page will document all of the completed objectives/ goals for a specific user,<br>
and also have charts, graphs, and other visual elements to provide further analysis<br>
on a user's progress with each of their objectives.
